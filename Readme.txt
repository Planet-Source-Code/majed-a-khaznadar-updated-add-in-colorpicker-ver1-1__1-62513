**************************
This is an enhanced version of the old k-colorpicker which submited previously here in PSC
Well, few things just added to this version, one of the best thing is the ability to capture any color you want directly from screen, and convert the color code to Hex so you can use it within you Visual Basic Projects!

PLEASE IF YOU FOUND THIS SOURCE CODE WAS USEFUL TO YOU, THEN BE SO GENEROUS ENOUGH AND GIVE ME SOME GLOBES, in other words Vote For Me! I'd appreciate that...
Thank You
